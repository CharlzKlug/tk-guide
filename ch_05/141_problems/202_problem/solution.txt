{Regular expressions are us}

* expressions
> regexp -inline -- {ex[^ ]*} "Regular expressions are useful and powerful"
expressions

* pow
> regexp -inline -- {po[^e]*} "Regular expressions are useful and powerful"

* useful and powerful
> regexp -inline -- {us.*$} "Regular expressions are useful and powerful"
